# Twitch_Bot
My personal twitch bot. A passion project, made to keep the joy of programming alive. 
The process of tuning it part by part is my love.

#Function:
	This bot is attempting to mimmic the average_chat_user. In persuit of that goal this bot is can sit in a channels chat, storing the messages and emote usage data.
	Once a set amount  is reached<PROCESS IS CURRENTLY MANUAL> it will digest the messages, based on criteria you set, into a training set for a DNN. 
	This DNN was made for tweets so it deals with twitch chat perfectly.
	It's setup to react to events in chat with pre-defined responces.
	Currently its setup to work best with CohhCarnage's community.

#Usage:
	py twitchBot.py [twitchChannel] [username] [oauth:token]
		Commands available upon PMing the bot
		Will listen to chat and talk with preprogrammed responces.
